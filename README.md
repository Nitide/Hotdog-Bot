# Hotdog-Bot: a super helpful Reddit bot (stopped)

When a user comments "hotdog", the bot will auto reply back with:

You put "hotdog", did you mean open-faced sausage sandwich? ðŸŒ­ 

The bot has received Reddit gold twice. ("gifts on your behalf have helped pay for 7.71 hours of reddit server time")

Limitations: 
* The bot cannot respond back on a subreddit it's banned from
* hotdog_bot is now shadowbanned
